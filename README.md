## Descripton

Script changes layout of the page 9gag.com with it's subpages to "night-mode"

## How to use:

First of all You have to install Mozilla Firefox and Greasemonkey plugin. *( You can do it with Tampermonkey on Chrome and the steps are quite similar)*

*My script was written on Greasemonkey 3.9 but should run on every versions with JQuery included.*

2. Click on down faced arrow next to the Greasemonkey icon on the plugin bar in your browser.
3. Next You wanna create "New Script" clicking this option in the pop-up menu.
4. Type in Name and description as You wish
5. In Namespace type "9gag.com" (without the quotation marks)
6. In Includes type "http://9gag.com/*" (without the quotation marks) so the script will be working on all subpages of 9gag
7. Now paste in the editor code in "firefox version" or "chrome version"
8. Click save. After that script should be running every time you enter 9gag
